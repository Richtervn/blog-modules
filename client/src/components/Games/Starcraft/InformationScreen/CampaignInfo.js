<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started to create these campaigns back in 1999 (I don't remember the exact day) on my old Pentium machine. Pentium 133MHz with 49Mb RAM running Windows 98 that is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't know much about campaign editing back then (not that I know much now!) but I decided to start working on some campaigns just after I finished the original Starcraft and its Broodwar Expansion Pack. My internet connection was a simple PSTN back then, so playing online games with other Starcraft fans was out of the question. The only way to get some extra Starcraft action was to create some campaigns of my own! And that's what I did. In about a year and a half (with some monthly breaks in between) I had created 5 campaigns.</p>
<p>Very few original ideas, extremely simple triggers, extremely simple story (if any), crappy dialogue and way too many language barriers (I'm Greek btw). I had then felt satisfied however(!) and I thought that I would never have to work on these levels again. Boy, was I wrong!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a particularly long break from Starcraft (a year must have been) I decided to have a look again at my campaigns. I was pretty let down. The levels and especialy the story seemed to have been made by an uninspired 12yo. I had to chose between two roads. Delete all my campaigns and just admit that 1,5 years of my life had gone to waste, or just spend MORE time trying to fix them. And that's what I did. I started working on my campaigns again, one by one, trying to alter/improve the story. In most levels the story has changed COMPLETELY, as well as the dialogue and the level design as a whole (save for the last campaign that hasn't been altered much). Unfortunately my 2nd campaign (it was a Zerg campaign) was really below standarts and could not fit in the new storyline either. Without much hesitation I deleted it, and I continued to work on my remaining campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most tiresome and time-consuming aspect of the campaign-making process was breaking the language barrier. I had the Greek-English and English-Greek dictionary beside me most of the time, constantly checking my spelling, my grammar, constantly trying to make sure I was making sense. That was a toughie!</p>
<p>And when I finally felt that the text/script was ok, then the most boring part of all would begin: duration adjustment! What that means, is that I would try to make each character "speak" slow enough so that the player has enough time to read, but also fast enough so that the player won't get tired and skip. I followed that procedure in the creation of mission briefings and in-game transmissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the middle of 2005 I had completed my campaigns by 2/3. I knew that my work would soon pay me off since seeing my levels finished (at last!) would be the perfect reward for my troubles. Then an incident happened that almost put an end to all my hopes of completing my campaigns. The hard disk partition that contained my only recent copies of my campaigns was rendered unreadable after a partition resizing error. I felt a total wreck. My other copies of my campaigns dated back to 2001. I wouldn't go through this again, not for all the money in the world! My only hope was to give the hard disk to someone more experienced than I, and have him try data recovery. I considered doing the data recovery myself but I feared that I would only make things worse. Besides, the way that the error occured left me with the impression that only a small part of the partition was destroyed; and that the files were unreachable but not lost. I regained hope and went to a computer-shop with my hard disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They employee there, listened carefully about the problem that caused the partition error. He told me to just forget about my data and reformat the partition. Of course that was out of the question. I explained him that I didn't matter how long it would take nor how much it would cost me. I just wanted my data back. Or whatever was left from them. The man understood that I was serious about it, so he told me that he'd give it a try.</p>
<p>After a week, I got word from him. He told me he had saved some of the data. That was all I needed to hear. The very same minute I went there and got my hard disk. I paid 100 euros and I didn't even care. Some people learn to backup the hard way I guess! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While a lot of other files where corrupt, my campaign files were alright. I backed them up again and again and again. And I continued to back them up as I made progress. Some of the last things I did was adding sounds and giving names to each scenario and each level. But I still didn't know how to call the whole project I've been working on all these years. I didn't have to think a lot. It was obvious that it should be called "A Starcraft Odyssey". Perfect!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kinda feel that the title "A Starcraft Odyssey" mostly fits on what I've been going through creating these campaigns all these years, rather than the in-game heroes' adventures!</p>
<p>But my Odyssey came to an end and the campaigns were finished in July 18th, 2006 on a Pentium 4 1,7GHz 512Mb RAM running Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was it worth it? I don't know. But I do know that I wouldn't attempt anything like that again.</p>
<p>I'm very glad I'm through with it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or am I?</p>

<li><strong><u> About The Game:</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These campaigns are for the war-torn veterans of Starcraft and Brood War. Only them might appreciate the storyline, let alone stand a chance against the beast that "A Starcraft Odyssey" is. But everyone else is welcome to try as well!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story picks up after the events on "Omega". That could mean some months after, or even a couple of years after (there is no strict time-frame). The only thing sure, is that most of the characters from Brood War are still alive and well, ready for the new circle of carnage!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how difficult are the campaigns? I hope this will enlighten you...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Newbies: </strong>Newbies won't be able to finish them. They'd better play Brood War once more!</p>
<p><strong>Medium:</strong> Medium players will have a very tough time to finish them. &lt;-- I belong here btw</p>
<p><strong>Experienced:</strong> Experienced players will have a tough time to finish them.</p>
<p><strong>Masters: </strong>Well, I don't know, these people are crazy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It needs to be clarified that although the general difficulty of my campaigns is very high, not all levels are extremely difficult. Some levels are in fact so easy that even newbies won't have a problem winning them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some other levels are not difficult, just tricky. That goes especialy for installation levels and levels in which you don't start with a base and you have to make due with your given units.</p>
<p>These kind of levels can range from easy to impossible, according to the way you will approach them. Try to play them with an open mind. Oh, and save a lot!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course, there are the difficult levels. Large battlefields filled with enemies ready to make your life a living hell! Brace yourself! There are lots of them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sounds/Music:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunatelly the campaign has no sounds for the characters' dialogues. I would need a team of people that could imitate voices for this one. Or at least a computer junkie that would know how to transform my voice into Kerrigan's, Raynor's, Zeratul's and so on. I'm not THAT mad!</p>
<p>As for original music for my campaigns: I haven't created any, and I don't know if I will. If I have time to create some music I like and it fits in the game, then I'll consider to release a "Special Edition" or "Full Edition" of my campaigns. But, for now you'll have to do with the "Original Edition". Don't hold your breath. There may not be an other (edition) !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Walkthrough:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no walkthrough right now and there are no plans for one in the future. Just pay attention to the mission briefings, check the mission objectives and do your best. Who needs walkthroughs (in strategy games) anyway? Do-it-yourself and be proud of it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Important! </u></strong><strong><u>&nbsp;Please read:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many levels of the "A Starcraft Odyssey" campaigns, are heavily triggered. To ensure that the triggers will execute correctly, you should follow the instructions bellow:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Never press the "ESC" button or some important triggers may not function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Never use cheats (extra section below)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> The game speed should preferably be set to "normal". (The game has been tested only on normal speed. It may work well in other speeds, or it may not. I don't know.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> First of all let me tell you that saving your game is a VERY good idea. Saving your game at any time doesn't affect the triggers (normally). However, prefer NOT to save your game during transmissions or when it is obvious that there is an important trigger being executed.</p>
<p>(I never experienced problems with a loaded game that I had saved during the execution of important triggers. But I may have just been lucky! Why push your luck?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><u> Known Issues:</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Installation / How to play:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The campaigns don't need installation. Just unzip the "A Starcraft Odyssey" folder inside the "maps" directory of your "Starcraft" directory. That was all. Now you can access them from the "Play Custom" menu. Don't forget to run them using the "Use Map Settings" option. (Stating the obvious...)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Copyright:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't worry, this section isn't about telling you that you shouldn't modify, copy and redistribute my campaigns. You may do with them as you wish. But be warned that some of these levels are VERY heavily triggered. Even the slightest changes can make them to not function properly. And if you don't mind, please don't modify the "Created by Funkybomber" string.</p>
<p>I had a hard time making these campaigns and it's only fair that I should take credit for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, not ALL things were done by me. I can't stress this enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOT ALL THINGS WERE DONE BY ME!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, now that it's pretty obvious, let's see what I did:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Character Names:</strong> With the obvious exception of characters that have existed on the original Starcraft and the Brood War expansion like Raynor, Kerrigan, Zeratul, the Overmind etc, ALL the NEW characters are products of my imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Script: </strong>The script was done ENTIRELY by me. That means that I'm the only one to blame for the bad storyline and the crappy dialogue. Of course I tried to stick to the way some characters used to speak (I tried at least) on the original Starcraft and the Brood War.</p>
<p>But other than that, everything is original. Heavily influenced surely, but still original.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Triggers:</strong> All mine. End of story. That's why some of them are so crappy after all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Before you go "OMG!!LOLmfzg!:)UdidntM8kethis:)LOL!" on me, calm down and read below. The terrain on MOST of my levels was created ENTIRELY by me. But back in 1999 there were many times that I was too bored to come up with my own terrains, so I worked on some terrains that were created by BLIZZARD. (That's one of the most important reasons that my 2nd campaign didn't make it to the final release. It was based on waaay too many "stolen" terrains that I hadn't even altered much.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's see which levels I <strong>didn't</strong> design from scratch:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Breakfast On Earth --&gt; (4)Zergling Round-Up.scm</li>
<li>Reclaiming The Beast --&gt; (4)Rivalry.scm</li>
<li>Good Medicine Hurtin' --&gt; (4)Crescent Moon.scx</li>
<li>Ice Drillers Gone Mad --&gt; (2)Ice Floes.scx</li>
<li>Hypatia, The Last Ground --&gt; (8)Plains of Snow '98.scm</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ALL other maps were created entirely by me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) </strong>While I was creating the campaigns it came to my attention that in some levels there was a (serious) problem: the string that indicated the level to load was swapped with some other string that was supposed to be a text message to be shown in the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted the triggers to be like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Display for current player: The door has been unlocked.</p>
<p>Load 'Zerg_level_5.scx' after completion of current game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>that would turn to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Display for current player: Zerg_level_5.scx</p>
<p>Load 'The door has been unlocked.' after completion of current game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thus causing BIG problems (and headaches) to me. I believe I have corrected all these problems wherever they occured BUT I still don't know what caused them.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that they could easily appear again and ruin your gaming pleasure. If something like that happens I'm really sorry. :( Please, PLEASE let me know in my e-mail if such a problem appears. I'll do my best to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> While I never had a problem with it, I've heard that maps that have been resized to a custom size (a-non-staredit-approved-size) may cause problems to some users.</p>
<p>The levels "7a. Nuck'em (chain 1)", "7b. Nuck'em (chain 2)" etc ARE RESIZED MAPS. If you have a problem playing these maps then I'm sorry but I can't help you.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should just skip these levels. If on the other hand you REALLY want to play them, resize them (on your own risk). One thing for sure: I won't waste time resizing/correcting a map that seems to work perfectly fine on my computer. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Problems because of protection: (update) The maps were unprotected after some unexpected problems showed up. No one can protect their maps nowadays after all...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cheat codes:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "A Starcraft Odyssey" campaigns should better be played without the use of cheat codes. But I guess that many of you WILL use cheat codes despite my warnings. Oh well, if you want to use cheat codes, read below to see what to expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Use of the "there is no cow level" cheat will most probably result in the next level of the campaign to not load. But you wouldn't want to use that cheat code now, would you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Use of other cheat codes and especialy "power overwhelming" may result in some triggers to not operate correctly. And if that happens, it's <strong>highly</strong> possible that you won't be able to complete the level. Use it at your own risk.</p>
